========================
Changes in version 0.9.2
========================

The following changes were implemented in Fabric 0.9.2:

Feature additions
=================

* N/A


Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`123`: Removed Cygwin from the "are we on Windows" test; now, only
  Python installs whose ``sys.platform`` says ``'win32'`` will use Windows-only
  code paths (e.g. importing of ``pywin32``).


Documentation updates
=====================

* Added a few new items to the :doc:`FAQ </faq>`.
* :issue:`173`: Simple but rather embarrassing typo fix in README. Thanks to
  Ted Nyman for the catch.
* :issue:`194`: Added a note to :doc:`the install docs </installation>` about a
  possible edge case some Windows 64-bit Python users may encounter.
